UserValueList is a wishlist/favorites/remember tool for MODX Revolution, which will give users the opportunity to save resources or other objects. 
 
UserValueList works pretty similar to "CookieList":http://github.com/Mark-H/CookieList except CookieList stores data in a cookie, whereas UserValueList stores the data in an extended field. UserValueList allows you to keep different lists (simply assign different keys), where CookieList only allows one cookie configuration per context.

UserValueList has been developed in January 2012 by "ScherpOntwikkeling":http://www.scherpontwikkeling.nl for "Mark Hamstra":http://www.markhamstra.com.
